          #     In this project, we introduced a new dataset of 307 folk songs
          #     from five different states of India. From these audio files, we extracted
          #     different features and tried to classify these songs into their original
          #     labels. Mel- Spectrograms, when given to a pre-trained ResNet-50 Model,
          #     produced better results than other features used in our experiment. Finally,
          #     the paper was accepted to FRMS'20 Conference.

              The project was a research-oriented work that involved extracting
              cepstral features from audio obtained from the ASVSpoof 2017 benchmark dataset,
              which were then analyzed to find out which features better affect the decision
              of whether the spoken speech is genuine or spoof.

          - description:
              The project involves developing a N-gram probabilistic model
              that predicts the next possible words based on the entered word or a sentence
              by the user. The prediction made by a pre-trained model trained on the text
              of multiple storybooks.

          - description:
              The project utilizes a combination of python and natural language
              processing to create a custom model that helps machine classify text based
              on person, location, money, time, date and much more. We show the use of
              Bidirectional LSTM and BERT Models to overcome the problem. The project
